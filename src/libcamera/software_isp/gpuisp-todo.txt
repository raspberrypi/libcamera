List the TODOs in perceived order of ease.


Denoising:
	- WIP

Dead pixel correction:
	- WIP

Lense shading correction:
	- WIP

Use dma-buf handle to generate upload texture:
	- eglCreateImageKHR can be used to generate the upload texture i.e.
	  to feed the bayer data into the GPU.

processFrame() to run in its own thread:
	- processFrame() runs in the context of the Debayer::process()
	  thread. Robert Mader suggested and it seems like a good
	  suggestion too to run processFrame() in its own thread.

Multi-pass shaders:
	- This needs some rewiring the idea is to have a list
	  of algorithms as is done in cpuisp iterating through the
	  list in a for() loop.
	- The logic managing the loop has an initial input buffer
	  and the final output buffer.
	- The higher level logic must then inform each of the
	  algorithms either to generate an internal working buffer
	  or pass the final output buffer to the last shader
	  in the list
	- This will allow for multi-pass shaders with the final
	  algorithm presenting data not to its internal buffer
	  but to the final output buffer

24 bit output support:
	- Need to implement compute shader to do this.

Lense flare correction:
	- Not WIP still TBD
