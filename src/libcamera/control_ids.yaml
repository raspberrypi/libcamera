  - AeMeteringMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify a metering mode for the AE algorithm to use. The metering
        modes determine which parts of the image are used to determine the
        scene brightness. Metering modes may be platform specific and not
        all metering modes may be supported.

  - AeConstraintMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify a constraint mode for the AE algorithm to use. These determine
        how the measured scene brightness is adjusted to reach the desired
        target exposure. Constraint modes may be platform specific, and not
        all constraint modes may be supported.
      enum:
        - name: ConstraintNormal
          value: 0
          description: Default constraint mode.
            This mode aims to balance the exposure of different parts of the
            image so as to reach a reasonable average level. However, highlights
            in the image may appear over-exposed and lowlights may appear
            under-exposed.
        - name: ConstraintHighlight
          value: 1
          description: Highlight constraint mode.
            This mode adjusts the exposure levels in order to try and avoid
            over-exposing the brightest parts (highlights) of an image.
            Other non-highlight parts of the image may appear under-exposed.
        - name: ConstraintShadows
          value: 2
          description: Shadows constraint mode.
            This mode adjusts the exposure levels in order to try and avoid
            under-exposing the dark parts (shadows) of an image. Other normally
            exposed parts of the image may appear over-exposed.
        - name: ConstraintCustom
          value: 3
          description: Custom constraint mode.
        - name: ConstraintModeMax
          value: 3
          description: Maximum allowed value (place any new values above here).

  # AeExposureMode needs further attention:
  # - Auto-generate max enum value.
  # - Better handling of custom types.
  - AeExposureMode:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Specify an exposure mode for the AE algorithm to use. These specify
        how the desired total exposure is divided between the shutter time
        and the sensor's analogue gain. The exposure modes are platform
        specific, and not all exposure modes may be supported.
      enum:

          description: Maximum allowed value (place any new values above here).

  - ExposureValue:
      type: float
      description: |
        Specify an Exposure Value (EV) parameter. The EV parameter will only be
        applied if the AE algorithm is currently enabled.

        By convention EV adjusts the exposure as log2. For example
        EV = [-2, -1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2] results in an exposure adjustment
        of [1/4x, 1/2x, 1/sqrt(2)x, 1x, sqrt(2)x, 2x, 4x].

  - ExposureTime:
      type: int32_t
      description: |
        Exposure time (shutter speed) for the frame applied in the sensor
        device. This value is specified in micro-seconds.

        \sa AnalogueGain AeEnable

  - AnalogueGain:
      type: float
      description: |
        Analogue gain value applied in the sensor device.
        The value of the control specifies the gain multiplier applied to all
        colour channels. This value cannot be lower than 1.0.

        \sa ExposureTime AeEnable

  - Brightness:
      type: float
      description: |
        Specify a fixed brightness parameter. Positive values (up to 1.0)
        produce brighter images; negative values (up to -1.0) produce darker
        images and 0.0 leaves pixels unchanged.

  - Contrast:
      type: float
      description:  |
        Specify a fixed contrast parameter. Normal contrast is given by the
        value 1.0; larger values produce images with more contrast.

  - Lux:
      type: float
      description: |
        Report an estimate of the current illuminance level in lux. The Lux
        control can only be returned in metadata.

  - Saturation:
      type: float
      description:  |
        Specify a fixed saturation parameter. Normal saturation is given by
        the value 1.0; larger values produce more saturated colours; 0.0
        produces a greyscale image.
