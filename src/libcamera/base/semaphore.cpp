 *
 * A semaphore is a locking primitive that protects resources. It is created
 * with an initial number of resources (which may be 0), and offers two
 * primitives to acquire and release resources. The acquire() function tries to
 * acquire a number of resources, and blocks if not enough resources are
 * available until they get released. The release() function releases a number
 * of resources, waking up any consumer blocked on an acquire() call.
