        The EV parameter will only be applied if the AE algorithm is currently

        By convention EV adjusts the exposure as log2. For example
        EV = [-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2] results in an exposure adjustment
        of [1/4x, 1/2x, 1/sqrt(2)x, 1x, sqrt(2)x, 2x, 4x].

        Exposure time for the frame applied in the sensor device.

        This value is specified in micro-seconds.

  - AnalogueGain:
      type: float
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Analogue gain value applied in the sensor device.

        The value of the control specifies the gain multiplier applied to all
        colour channels. This value cannot be lower than 1.0.

        Setting this value means that it is now fixed and the AE algorithm may
        not change it. Setting it back to zero returns it to the control of the
        AE algorithm.

  - AeFlickerMode:
      type: int32_t
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Set the flicker avoidance mode for AGC/AEC.

        The flicker mode determines whether, and how, the AGC/AEC algorithm
        attempts to hide flicker effects caused by the duty cycle of artificial
        lighting.

        Although implementation dependent, many algorithms for "flicker
        avoidance" work by restricting this exposure time to integer multiples
        of the cycle period, wherever possible.

        Implementations may not support all of the flicker modes listed below.

        By default the system will start in FlickerAuto mode if this is
        supported, otherwise the flicker mode will be set to FlickerOff.

      enum:
        - name: FlickerOff
          value: 0
          description: |

            Manual flicker avoidance.

            Suppress flicker effects caused by lighting running with a period
            specified by the AeFlickerPeriod control.
            \sa AeFlickerPeriod
        - name: FlickerAuto
          value: 2
          description: |
            Automatic flicker period detection and avoidance.

            The system will automatically determine the most likely value of
            flicker period, and avoid flicker of this frequency. Once flicker
            is being corrected, it is implementation dependent whether the
            system is still able to detect a change in the flicker period.
            \sa AeFlickerDetected

  - AeFlickerPeriod:
      type: int32_t
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Manual flicker period in microseconds.

        This value sets the current flicker period to avoid. It is used when
        AeFlickerMode is set to FlickerManual.

        To cancel 50Hz mains flicker, this should be set to 10000 (corresponding
        to 100Hz), or 8333 (120Hz) for 60Hz mains.

        Setting the mode to FlickerManual when no AeFlickerPeriod has ever been
        set means that no flicker cancellation occurs (until the value of this
        control is updated).

        Switching to modes other than FlickerManual has no effect on the
        value of the AeFlickerPeriod control.

        \sa AeFlickerMode

  - AeFlickerDetected:
      type: int32_t
      direction: out
      description: |
        Flicker period detected in microseconds.

        The value reported here indicates the currently detected flicker
        period, or zero if no flicker at all is detected.

        When AeFlickerMode is set to FlickerAuto, there may be a period during
        which the value reported here remains zero. Once a non-zero value is
        reported, then this is the flicker period that has been detected and is
        now being cancelled.

        In the case of 50Hz mains flicker, the value would be 10000
        (corresponding to 100Hz), or 8333 (120Hz) for 60Hz mains flicker.

        It is implementation dependent whether the system can continue to detect
        flicker of different periods when another frequency is already being
        cancelled.

  - Brightness:
      type: float
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Specify a fixed brightness parameter.

        Positive values (up to 1.0) produce brighter images; negative values
        (up to -1.0) produce darker images and 0.0 leaves pixels unchanged.

  - Contrast:
      type: float
      direction: inout
      description:  |
        Specify a fixed contrast parameter.

        Normal contrast is given by the value 1.0; larger values produce images
        with more contrast.

  - Lux:
      type: float
      direction: out
      description: |

        When AWB is enabled, the algorithm estimates the colour temperature of
        the scene and computes colour gains and the colour correction matrix
        automatically. The computed colour temperature, gains and correction
        matrix are reported in metadata. The corresponding controls are ignored
        if set in a request.

        When AWB is disabled, the colour temperature, gains and correction

      direction: inout
      description:  |
        Intensity of the sharpening applied to the image.

        A value of 0.0 means no sharpening. The minimum value means
        minimal sharpening, and shall be 0.0 unless the camera can't
        disable sharpening completely. The default value shall give a
        "reasonable" level of sharpening, suitable for most use cases.
        The maximum value may apply extremely high levels of sharpening,
        higher than anyone could reasonably want. Negative values are
        not allowed. Note also that sharpening is not applied to raw
        streams.

  - FocusFoM:
      type: int32_t
      direction: out
      description: |
        Reports a Figure of Merit (FoM) to indicate how in-focus the frame is.

        A larger FocusFoM value indicates a more in-focus frame. This singular
        value may be based on a combination of statistics gathered from
        multiple focus regions within an image. The number of focus regions and
        method of combination is platform dependent. In this respect, it is not
        necessarily aimed at providing a way to implement a focus algorithm by
        the application, rather an indication of how in-focus a frame is.

        the final output image.

        The (x,y) location of this rectangle is relative to the
        PixelArrayActiveAreas that is being used. The units remain native
        sensor pixels, even if the sensor is being used in a binning or
        skipping mode.

        This control is only present when the pipeline supports scaling. Its
        maximum valid value is given by the properties::ScalerCropMaximum
        property, and the two can be used to implement digital zoom.

  - DigitalGain:

      direction: inout
      description: |
        Digital gain value applied during the processing steps applied
        to the image as captured from the sensor.

        The global digital gain factor is applied to all the colour channels
        of the RAW image. Different pipeline models are free to
        specify how the global gain factor applies to each separate
        channel.

        If an imaging pipeline applies digital gain in distinct
        processing steps, this value indicates their total sum.
        Pipelines are free to decide how to adjust each processing
        step to respect the received gain factor and shall report
        their total value in the request metadata.

  - FrameDuration:
      type: int64_t
      direction: out
      description: |
        The instantaneous frame duration from start of frame exposure to start
        of next exposure, expressed in microseconds.

        This control is meant to be returned in metadata.

  - FrameDurationLimits:
      type: int64_t
      direction: inout
      description: |
        The minimum and maximum (in that order) frame duration, expressed in
        microseconds.

        When provided by applications, the control specifies the sensor frame
        duration interval the pipeline has to use. This limits the largest
        exposure time the sensor can use. For example, if a maximum frame
        duration of 33ms is requested (corresponding to 30 frames per second),
        the sensor will not be able to raise the exposure time above 33ms.
        A fixed frame duration is achieved by setting the minimum and maximum
        values to be the same. Setting both values to 0 reverts to using the
        camera defaults.

        The maximum frame duration provides the absolute limit to the exposure
        time computed by the AE algorithm and it overrides any exposure mode
        setting specified with controls::AeExposureMode. Similarly, when a
        manual exposure time is set through controls::ExposureTime, it also
        gets clipped to the limits set by this control. When reported in
        metadata, the control expresses the minimum and maximum frame durations
        used after being clipped to the sensor provided frame duration limits.

        Temperature measure from the camera sensor in Celsius.

        This value is typically obtained by a thermal sensor present on-die or

            If the camera is started in AfModeManual, it will move the focus
            lens to the position specified by the LensPosition control.

            This mode is the recommended default value for the AfMode control.
            External cameras (as reported by the Location property set to

            used to initiate a focus scan, the results of which will be
            reported by AfState.

            If the autofocus algorithm is moved from AfModeAuto to another mode
            while a scan is in progress, the scan is cancelled immediately,
            without waiting for the scan to finish.

            When first entering this mode the AfState will report AfStateIdle.
            When a trigger control is sent, AfState will report AfStateScanning
            for a period before spontaneously changing to AfStateFocused or
            AfStateFailed, depending on the outcome of the scan. It will remain
            in this state until another scan is initiated by the AfTrigger
            control. If a scan is cancelled (without changing to another mode),
            AfState will return to AfStateIdle.
        - name: AfModeContinuous
          value: 2
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in continuous mode.

            In this mode the lens can re-start a scan spontaneously at any
            moment, without any user intervention. The AfState still reports
            whether the algorithm is currently scanning or not, though the
            application has no ability to initiate or cancel scans, nor to move
            the lens for itself.

            However, applications can pause the AF algorithm from continuously
            scanning by using the AfPause control. This allows video or still
            images to be captured whilst guaranteeing that the focus is fixed.

            When set to AfModeContinuous, the system will immediately initiate a
            scan so AfState will report AfStateScanning, and will settle on one
            of AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed, depending on the scan result.

        Determine whether the AF is to move the lens as quickly as possible or

        For example, during video recording it may be desirable not to move the
        lens too abruptly, but when in a preview mode (waiting for a still
        capture) it may be helpful to move the lens as quickly as is reasonably
        possible.

          description: |
            Use the rectangles defined by the AfWindows control to measure focus.

            If no windows are specified the behaviour is platform dependent.

  - AfWindows:
      type: Rectangle
      direction: inout
      description: |
        The focus windows used by the AF algorithm when AfMetering is set to
        AfMeteringWindows.

        The units used are pixels within the rectangle returned by the
        ScalerCropMaximum property.

        In order to be activated, a rectangle must be programmed with non-zero
        width and height. Internally, these rectangles are intersected with the
        ScalerCropMaximum rectangle. If the window becomes empty after this
        operation, then the window is ignored. If all the windows end up being
        ignored, then the behaviour is platform dependent.

        On platforms that support the ScalerCrop control (for implementing
        digital zoom, for example), no automatic recalculation or adjustment of
        AF windows is performed internally if the ScalerCrop is changed. If any
        window lies outside the output image after the scaler crop has been
        applied, it is up to the application to recalculate them.

        The details of how the windows are used are platform dependent. We note
        that when there is more than one AF window, a typical implementation
        might find the optimal focus position for each one and finally select
        the window where the focal distance for the objects shown in that part
        of the image are closest to the camera.

  - AfTrigger:
      type: int32_t
      direction: in
      description: |
        Start an autofocus scan.

        This control starts an autofocus scan when AfMode is set to AfModeAuto,
        and is ignored if AfMode is set to AfModeManual or AfModeContinuous. It
        can also be used to terminate a scan early.

      enum:
        - name: AfTriggerStart
          value: 0
          description: |
            Start an AF scan.

            Setting the control to AfTriggerStart is ignored if a scan is in

        - name: AfTriggerCancel
          value: 1
          description: |

            This does not cause the lens to move anywhere else. Ignored if no
            scan is in progress.

  - AfPause:
      type: int32_t
      direction: in
      description: |
        Pause lens movements when in continuous autofocus mode.

        This control has no effect except when in continuous autofocus mode
        (AfModeContinuous). It can be used to pause any lens movements while
        (for example) images are captured. The algorithm remains inactive
        until it is instructed to resume.

      enum:
        - name: AfPauseImmediate
          value: 0
          description: |
            Pause the continuous autofocus algorithm immediately.

            The autofocus algorithm is paused whether or not any kind of scan
            is underway. AfPauseState will subsequently report
            AfPauseStatePaused. AfState may report any of AfStateScanning,
            AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed, depending on the algorithm's state
            when it received this control.
        - name: AfPauseDeferred
          value: 1
          description: |
            Pause the continuous autofocus algorithm at the end of the scan.

            This is similar to AfPauseImmediate, and if the AfState is
            currently reporting AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed it will remain
            in that state and AfPauseState will report AfPauseStatePaused.

            However, if the algorithm is scanning (AfStateScanning),
            AfPauseState will report AfPauseStatePausing until the scan is
            finished, at which point AfState will report one of AfStateFocused
            or AfStateFailed, and AfPauseState will change to
            AfPauseStatePaused.

        - name: AfPauseResume
          value: 2
          description: |
            Resume continuous autofocus operation.

            The algorithm starts again from exactly where it left off, and
            AfPauseState will report AfPauseStateRunning.

  - LensPosition:
      type: float
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Set and report the focus lens position.

        This control instructs the lens to move to a particular position and
        also reports back the position of the lens for each frame.

        The LensPosition control is ignored unless the AfMode is set to
        AfModeManual, though the value is reported back unconditionally in all
        modes.

        This value, which is generally a non-integer, is the reciprocal of the
        focal distance in metres, also known as dioptres. That is, to set a
        focal distance D, the lens position LP is given by

        \f$LP = \frac{1\mathrm{m}}{D}\f$

        For example:

        - 0 moves the lens to infinity.
        - 0.5 moves the lens to focus on objects 2m away.
        - 2 moves the lens to focus on objects 50cm away.
        - And larger values will focus the lens closer.

        The default value of the control should indicate a good general
        position for the lens, often corresponding to the hyperfocal distance
        (the closest position for which objects at infinity are still
        acceptably sharp). The minimum will often be zero (meaning infinity),
        and the maximum value defines the closest focus position.

        \todo Define a property to report the Hyperfocal distance of calibrated
        lenses.

  - AfState:
      type: int32_t
      direction: out
      description: |
        The current state of the AF algorithm.

        This control reports the current state of the AF algorithm in
        conjunction with the reported AfMode value and (in continuous AF mode)
        the AfPauseState value. The possible state changes are described below,
        though we note the following state transitions that occur when the
        AfMode is changed.

        If the AfMode is set to AfModeManual, then the AfState will always
        report AfStateIdle (even if the lens is subsequently moved). Changing
        to the AfModeManual state does not initiate any lens movement.

        If the AfMode is set to AfModeAuto then the AfState will report
        AfStateIdle. However, if AfModeAuto and AfTriggerStart are sent
        together then AfState will omit AfStateIdle and move straight to
        AfStateScanning (and start a scan).

        If the AfMode is set to AfModeContinuous then the AfState will
        initially report AfStateScanning.

      enum:
        - name: AfStateIdle
          value: 0
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in manual mode (AfModeManual) or in auto mode
            (AfModeAuto) and a scan has not yet been triggered, or an
            in-progress scan was cancelled.
        - name: AfStateScanning
          value: 1
          description: |
            The AF algorithm is in auto mode (AfModeAuto), and a scan has been
            started using the AfTrigger control.

            The scan can be cancelled by sending AfTriggerCancel at which point
            the algorithm will either move back to AfStateIdle or, if the scan
            actually completes before the cancel request is processed, to one
            of AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed.

            Alternatively the AF algorithm could be in continuous mode
            (AfModeContinuous) at which point it may enter this state
            spontaneously whenever it determines that a rescan is needed.

        This control is only applicable in continuous (AfModeContinuous) mode,
        and reports whether the algorithm is currently running, paused or
        pausing (that is, will pause as soon as any in-progress scan
        completes).

        Any change to AfMode will cause AfPauseStateRunning to be reported.

        - name: AfPauseStateRunning
          value: 0

      description: |
        Set the mode to be used for High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging.

        HDR techniques typically include multiple exposure, image fusion and
        tone mapping techniques to improve the dynamic range of the resulting
        images.

        When using an HDR mode, images are captured with different sets of AGC
        settings called HDR channels. Channels indicate in particular the type
        of exposure (short, medium or long) used to capture the raw image,
        before fusion. Each HDR image is tagged with the corresponding channel
        using the HdrChannel control.

            with the correct HDR channel, indicating what kind of exposure it
            is. The tag should be the same as in the HdrModeMultiExposure case.

            The expectation is that an application using this mode would merge
            the frames to create HDR images for itself if it requires them.

            short) that arrived and which caused this image to be output.

            Systems that use two channels for HDR will return images tagged
            alternately as the short and long channel. Systems that use three
