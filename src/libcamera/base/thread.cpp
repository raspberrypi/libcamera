/**
 * \page thread Thread Support
 *
 * libcamera supports multi-threaded applications through a threading model that
 * sets precise rules to guarantee thread-safe usage of the API. Additionally,
 * libcamera makes internal use of threads, and offers APIs that simplify
 * interactions with application threads. Careful compliance with the threading
 * model will ensure avoidance of race conditions.
 *
 * Every thread created by libcamera is associated with an instance of the
 * Thread class. Those threads run an internal event loop by default to
 * dispatch events to objects. Additionally, the main thread of the application
 * (defined as the thread that calls CameraManager::start()) is also associated
 * with a Thread instance, but has no event loop accessible to libcamera. Other
 * application threads are not visible to libcamera.
 *
 * \section thread-objects Threads and Objects
 *
 * Instances of the Object class and all its derived classes are thread-aware
 * and are bound to the thread they are created in. They are said to *live* in
 * a thread, and they interact with the event loop of their thread for the
 * purpose of message passing and signal delivery. Messages posted to the
 * object with Object::postMessage() will be delivered from the event loop of
 * the thread that the object lives in. Signals delivered to the object, unless
 * explicitly connected with ConnectionTypeDirect, will also be delivered from
 * the object thread's event loop.
 *
 * All Object instances created internally by libcamera are bound to internal
 * threads. As objects interact with thread event loops for proper operation,
 * creating an Object instance in a thread that has no internal event loop (such
 * as the main application thread, or libcamera threads that have a custom main
 * loop), prevents some features of the Object class from being used. See
 * Thread::exec() for more details.
 *
 * \section thread-signals Threads and Signals
 *
 * When sent to a receiver that does not inherit from the Object class, signals
 * are delivered synchronously in the thread of the sender. When the receiver
 * inherits from the Object class, delivery is by default asynchronous if the
 * sender and receiver live in different threads. In that case, the signal is
 * posted to the receiver's message queue and will be delivered from the
 * receiver's event loop, running in the receiver's thread. This mechanism can
 * be overridden by selecting a different connection type when calling
 * Signal::connect().

/**
 * \class Thread
 * \brief A thread of execution
 *
 * The Thread class is a wrapper around std::thread that handles integration
 * with the Object, Signal and EventDispatcher classes.
 *
 * Thread instances by default run an event loop until the exit() function is
 * called. The event loop dispatches events (messages, notifiers and timers)
 * sent to the objects living in the thread. This behaviour can be modified by
 * overriding the run() function.
 *
 * \section thread-stop Stopping Threads
 *
 * Threads can't be forcibly stopped. Instead, a thread user first requests the
 * thread to exit and then waits for the thread's main function to react to the
 * request and return, at which points the thread will stop.
 *
 * For threads running exec(), the exit() function is used to request the thread
 * to exit. For threads subclassing the Thread class and implementing a custom
 * run() function, a subclass-specific mechanism shall be provided. In either
 * case, the wait() function shall be called to wait for the thread to stop.
 *
 * Due to their asynchronous nature, threads are subject to race conditions when
 * they stop. This is of particular importance for messages posted to the thread
 * with postMessage() (and the other mechanisms that rely on it, such as
 * Object::invokeMethod() or asynchronous signal delivery). To understand the
 * issues, three contexts need to be considered:
 *
 * - The worker is the Thread performing work and being instructed to stop.
 * - The controller is the context which instructs the worker thread to stop.
 * - The other contexts are any threads other than the worker and controller
 *   that interact with the worker thread.
 *
 * Messages posted to the worker thread from the controller context before
 * calling exit() are queued to the thread's message queue, and the Thread class
 * offers no guarantee that those messages will be processed before the thread
 * stops. This allows threads to stop fast.
 *
 * A thread that requires delivery of messages posted from the controller
 * context before exit() should reimplement the run() function and call
 * dispatchMessages() after exec().
 *
 * Messages posted to the worker thread from the other contexts are asynchronous
 * with respect to the exit() call from the controller context. There is no
 * guarantee as to whether those messages will be processed or not before the
 * thread stops.
 *
 * Messages that are not processed will stay in the queue, in the exact same way
 * as messages posted after the thread has stopped. They will be processed when
 * the thread is restarted. If the thread is never restarted, they will be
 * deleted without being processed when the Thread instance is destroyed.
