      description: |
        Specifies the number of pipeline stages the frame went through from when
        it was exposed to when the final completed result was available to the
        framework. Always less than or equal to PipelineMaxDepth. Currently
        identical to ANDROID_REQUEST_PIPELINE_DEPTH.

        The typical value for this control is 3 as a frame is first exposed,
        captured and then processed in a single pass through the ISP. Any
        additional processing step performed after the ISP pass (in example face
        detection, additional format conversions etc) count as an additional
        pipeline stage.

        indicates per-frame control. Currently identical to
        ANDROID_SYNC_MAX_LATENCY.

  - TestPatternMode:
      type: int32_t
      direction: inout
      description: |
        Control to select the test pattern mode. Currently identical to
        ANDROID_SENSOR_TEST_PATTERN_MODE.
      enum:
        - name: TestPatternModeOff
          value: 0
          description: |
            No test pattern mode is used. The camera device returns frames from
            the image sensor.
        - name: TestPatternModeSolidColor
          value: 1
          description: |
            Each pixel in [R, G_even, G_odd, B] is replaced by its respective
            color channel provided in test pattern data.
            \todo Add control for test pattern data.
        - name: TestPatternModeColorBars
          value: 2
          description: |
            All pixel data is replaced with an 8-bar color pattern. The vertical
            bars (left-to-right) are as follows; white, yellow, cyan, green,
            magenta, red, blue and black. Each bar should take up 1/8 of the
            sensor pixel array width. When this is not possible, the bar size
            should be rounded down to the nearest integer and the pattern can
            repeat on the right side. Each bar's height must always take up the
            full sensor pixel array height.
        - name: TestPatternModeColorBarsFadeToGray
          value: 3
          description: |
            The test pattern is similar to TestPatternModeColorBars,
            except that each bar should start at its specified color at the top
            and fade to gray at the bottom. Furthermore each bar is further
            subdevided into a left and right half. The left half should have a
            smooth gradient, and the right half should have a quantized
            gradient. In particular, the right half's should consist of blocks
            of the same color for 1/16th active sensor pixel array width. The
            least significant bits in the quantized gradient should be copied
            from the most significant bits of the smooth gradient. The height of
            each bar should always be a multiple of 128. When this is not the
            case, the pattern should repeat at the bottom of the image.
        - name: TestPatternModePn9
          value: 4
          description: |
            All pixel data is replaced by a pseudo-random sequence generated
            from a PN9 512-bit sequence (typically implemented in hardware with
            a linear feedback shift register). The generator should be reset at
            the beginning of each frame, and thus each subsequent raw frame with
            this test pattern should be exactly the same as the last.
        - name: TestPatternModeCustom1
          value: 256
          description: |
            The first custom test pattern. All custom patterns that are
            available only on this camera device are at least this numeric
            value. All of the custom test patterns will be static (that is the
            raw image must not vary from frame to frame).

            FaceDetectFaceRectangles and FaceDetectFaceScores controls for each
            detected face. FaceDetectFaceLandmarks and FaceDetectFaceIds are
            optional.

        face is visible to the camera device. A face that leaves the field of
