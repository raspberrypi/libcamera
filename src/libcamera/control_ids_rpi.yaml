# Raspberry Pi (VC4 and PiSP) specific vendor controls
vendor: rpi
controls:
  - StatsOutputEnable:
      type: bool
      description: |
        Toggles the Raspberry Pi IPA to output the hardware generated statistics.

        When this control is set to true, the IPA outputs a binary dump of the
        hardware generated statistics through the Request metadata in the
        Bcm2835StatsOutput control.

        \sa Bcm2835StatsOutput

  - Bcm2835StatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the BCM2835 ISP generated statistics for the current frame.

        This is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is set to
        true.  The statistics struct definition can be found in
        include/linux/bcm2835-isp.h.

        \sa StatsOutputEnable

  - ScalerCrops:
      type: Rectangle
      size: [n]
      description: |
        An array of rectangles, where each singular value has identical
        functionality to the ScalerCrop control. This control allows the
        Raspberry Pi pipeline handler to control individual scaler crops per
        output stream.

        The order of rectangles passed into the control must match the order of
        streams configured by the application. The pipeline handler will only
        configure crop retangles up-to the number of output streams configured.
        All subsequent rectangles passed into this control are ignored by the
        pipeline handler.

        If both rpi::ScalerCrops and ScalerCrop controls are present in a
        ControlList, the latter is discarded, and crops are obtained from this
        control.

        Note that using different crop rectangles for each output stream with
        this control is only applicable on the Pi5/PiSP platform. This control
        should also be considered temporary/draft and will be replaced with
        official libcamera API support for per-stream controls in the future.

        \sa ScalerCrop

  - PispStatsOutput:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        Span of the PiSP Frontend ISP generated statistics for the current
        frame. This is sent in the Request metadata if the StatsOutputEnable is
        set to true. The statistics struct definition can be found in
        https://github.com/raspberrypi/libpisp/blob/main/src/libpisp/frontend/pisp_statistics.h

        \sa StatsOutputEnable

  - CnnOutputTensor:
      type: float
      size: [n]
      description: |
        This control returns a span of floating point values that represent the
        output tensors from a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The size and
        format of this array of values is entirely dependent on the neural
        network used, and further post-processing may need to be performed at
        the application level to generate the final desired output. This control
        is agnostic of the hardware or software used to generate the output
        tensors.

        The structure of the span is described by the CnnOutputTensorInfo
        control.

        \sa CnnOutputTensorInfo

  - CnnOutputTensorInfo:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        This control returns the structure of the CnnOutputTensor. This structure
        takes the following form:

        constexpr unsigned int NetworkNameLen = 64;
        constexpr unsigned int MaxNumTensors = 8;
        constexpr unsigned int MaxNumDimensions = 8;

        struct CnnOutputTensorInfo {
          char networkName[NetworkNameLen];
          uint32_t numTensors;
          OutputTensorInfo info[MaxNumTensors];
        };

        with

        struct OutputTensorInfo {
          uint32_t tensorDataNum;
          uint32_t numDimensions;
          uint16_t size[MaxNumDimensions];
        };

        networkName is the name of the CNN used,
        numTensors is the number of output tensors returned,
        tensorDataNum gives the number of elements in each output tensor,
        numDimensions gives the dimensionality of each output tensor,
        size gives the size of each dimension in each output tensor.

        \sa CnnOutputTensor

  - CnnEnableInputTensor:
      type: bool
      description: |
        Boolean to control if the IPA returns the input tensor used by the CNN
        to generate the output tensors via the CnnInputTensor control. Because
        the input tensor may be relatively large, for efficiency reason avoid
        enabling input tensor output unless required for debugging purposes.

        \sa CnnInputTensor

  - CnnInputTensor:
       type: uint8_t
       size: [n]
       description: |
        This control returns a span of uint8_t pixel values that represent the
        input tensor for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The size and
        format of this array of values is entirely dependent on the neural
        network used, and further post-processing (e.g. pixel normalisations) may
        need to be performed at the application level to generate the final input
        image.

        The structure of the span is described by the CnnInputTensorInfo
        control.

        \sa CnnInputTensorInfo

  - CnnInputTensorInfo:
      type: uint8_t
      size: [n]
      description: |
        This control returns the structure of the CnnInputTensor. This structure
        takes the following form:

        constexpr unsigned int NetworkNameLen = 64;

        struct CnnInputTensorInfo {
          char networkName[NetworkNameLen];
          uint32_t width;
          uint32_t height;
          uint32_t numChannels;
        };

        where

        networkName is the name of the CNN used,
        width and height are the input tensor image width and height in pixels,
        numChannels is the number of channels in the input tensor image.

        \sa CnnInputTensor

  - CnnKpiInfo:
      type: int32_t
      size: [2]
      description: |
        This control returns performance metrics for the CNN processing stage.
        Two values are returned in this span, the runtime of the CNN/DNN stage
        and the DSP stage in milliseconds.
